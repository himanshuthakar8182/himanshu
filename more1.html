                                       <h4><b>Joker Review:-</b></h4>

                                        Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) isn’t happy with his life. He struggles to make money as a part-time clown while sharing a rundown apartment with his ailing mom (Frances Conroy). But Arthur lives in a city struck by hard times where a decent, honest living is difficult to come by. He also suffers from a condition that causes him to break into uncontrollable laughter. None of this stops Arthur from dreaming big. He aspires to be a stand-up comedian and attempts to write jokes in his diary. Caught in between it all, Arthur slowly begins to lose his grip on sanity.

                                       <h4><b>Fast fourier 9 - Review:-</b></h4>

                                       I felt compelled to write this review one hour into the movie (couldn't carry on for obvious reasons)... We all knew the franchise was steadily worsening but this one takes the cake. I don't think you can make something utterly ridiculous even on purpose.I usually enjoy this franchise and have seen every movie multiple times. Unfortunately F9 was the most ridiculous, unbelievable, far fetched nonsense I've ever seen. It was so dumb to the point that I wasn't entertained. Talk about disappointing.


                                       Couldn't bear to watch beyond 20 minutes. Toretto's younger self has no resemblance to him now whatsoever. And that's the least of the utterly ridiculous things that the filmmaker's trying to make you buy into for 2 hours. Lame dialogue. I love British accents but this one I just could not bear any longer.

Their objective: to extract the much-needed minerals from Pandora's soil. But before they can do that, they must fight the peace-loving indigenous inhabitants of the alien world, relocate or destroy them with their spies and bombs.

                                        And we thought sinking the Titanic was a titan task! Well, this time round, James Cameron chooses to play god and creates a whole new world with such exquisite finesse, aesthete and eye for detail, he almost takes your breath away. In terms of sheer technology, Avatar marks the coming of age of both CGI and 3-D cinema with its art house special effects and its shock and awe treatment.On the one hand, it's the sheer iridescence of the canvas and the never-before contours of the creatures, the flora, the fauna flying across the screen that makes you marvel at how computers can augment creativity; on the other, it is the umpteen times you jump back to avoid the arrows, the guns or slide away from the floating dandelions and fierce raptors that leaves you completely mesmerised with this brand new cinematic experience. Truly, Cameron's vision of Pandora is pure art, with its tall, wide-eyed, slender, blue Na'vi people, it's post-modern creatures and its verdant greens.

                                        Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) isn’t happy with his life. He struggles to make money as a part-time clown while sharing a rundown apartment with his ailing mom (Frances Conroy). But Arthur lives in a city struck by hard times where a decent, honest living is difficult to come by. He also suffers from a condition that causes him to break into uncontrollable laughter. None of this stops Arthur from dreaming big. He aspires to be a stand-up comedian and attempts to write jokes in his diary. Caught in between it all, Arthur slowly begins to lose his grip on sanity.

                                        This movie is actually much better than the other reviews here say. Don't get me wrong, it's not really a good movie, and a lot of what people are saying is true: the plot is both nonsensical and predictable, the performances are uneven to say the least, and the whole thing sometimes veers into unintentional comedy. What the movie gets right though is good pacing, well done action scenes (albeit only two, very brief, ones), and a charming lead in Haylie Duff, a much better actress then her career so far requires or would imply. So not some sort of hidden gem or future cult classic, but a perfectly pleasant watch.<br>

                                       <h4><b>Black commando Story:-</b></h4> The Moorish general Othello is manipulated into thinking that his new wife Desdemona has been carrying on an affair with his lieutenant Michael Cassio when in reality it is all part of the scheme of a bitter ensign named Iago.<br><br>

                                       <h4><b>Black commando Review:-</b></h4>

                                          Yes, this is a version of Othello and yes, that is Tony Curtis from Hollywood's golden age playing Iago. It would have been funnier is he was playing Othello, but you can't have it all I guess.This is modern Othello, so now he's general Othello, a gun for hire in Africa who is working for the Red Cross when he claps eyes on Desdemona, an aid worker from the US. At first these two hate each other but soon it's romantic love montage time, all watched by the ever jealous, scheming, Iago. I've got to admit I felt like I was watching Tony Curtis, but it looked to me like Tony Curtis was channelling b-movie actor Cameron Mitchell!<br>


                                          Iago's speech is all modern and both he and Desdemona's father are dropping the 'N' word like this was written by Quentin Shakespeare, but if you're among the billions of people forced to read the play at school, you'll know how this one pans out anyway. It's one of Shakespeare's tragedies. For some reason Shakespeare wasn't in to warning his viewers by having a spoiler warning.
