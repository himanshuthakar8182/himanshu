                            <h3><b>Maharshi review :-</b></h3>

                            It’s not the first time that Indian cinema has tried to address a prevalent social issue through commercially entertaining means. And that is exactly what Maharshi does – going from being the story of a man who wants to dream beyond his means to someone who will go on to be the people’s saviour, even if it’s not something he actively seeks out.<br>

                            Rishi (Mahesh Babu) climbs the corporate ladder hard and fast till he’s the CEO of a company called Origins. It has always been his dream to achieve success and to not be like his father (Prakash Raj) whom he views as a failure. So much so, that his fear of failure keeps pushing him to do better than he ever wants to. But he soon finds out it is his college friend Ravi (Allari Naresh) to whom he owes his success. Seeking out his old friend at Ramavaram, Rishi is pushed into something far more than just repaying a debt he owes.

                            <h3><b>Dear comrade review :-</b></h3>

                             The day I become more important to you than cricket, Vijay Deverakonda tells Rashmika at a key moment in Bharat Kamma's Dear Comrade. At the time of viewing, the scene just seems like an aside, a minor cog in the narration. However, Bharat Kamma carefully weaves his narration to circle back to this underlying message — no woman should give up their passion for love. Dear Comrade has drama, anger and loads of passion but the storytelling is elevated by the lead cast and some brilliant cinematography that ensures the film stays with you for long after you leave the theatre.<br>

                             Dear Comrade's greatest plus is that it never becomes one-dimensional. There are moments when you feel like you can predict what happens next from a mile away, but what follows next takes you by surprise. It's not just about Bobby's anger or Lilly's despair. At each juncture, the story takes a different turn, and more often than not, it's for the better. The storytelling is enhanced with some excellent background music and terrific cinematography.

                            <h3><b>Khoonkhar review :-</b></h3>

                             For one man, it is a question of pride, for another it is a question of love. To what extent will they go to stand up for what they believe in? Who will ultimately triumph in this clash of personalities?<br>


                             Gagan (Bellamkonda Srinivas) and Janaki alias Sweety (Rakul Preet) are students of the same college. But Gagan is not your typical guy — the young man rejects the advances of girls and is extremely devoted to his father (Sarath Kumar) and brother (Nandu). Despite being very rich, Sarath Kumar has the reputation of being an alcoholic. But there is a reason behind this. Impressed by Gagan’s character, Janaki falls in love with him and he reciprocates. Her sweet, kind nature endears her to his family.<br>

                             The film essentially is an interplay of various circumstances among all these key characters, and ultimately poses threat to the well-being of Gagan and his family. What are those circumstances and how does Gagan face those challenges to protect his loved ones?

                           <h3><b>Ala vaikunthapurramulloreview :-</b></h3>

                           Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo is set in the soft-tinted, beautifully framed, pastel hued cotton-candy-land that Trivikram Srinivas builds. The evil-doers here are left to their own devices, in hope that karma will get to them. And when that doesn’t work, they’re of course beaten up black and blue, but in style. The film sets up a lot of characters and ends up showcasing scenarios that are completely implausible. But the film’s biggest strength is that you buy it all, even if Trivikram, yet again, tells the tale of a man who wants to help a family he cares about.<br>

                           The bane of Bantu’s (Allu Arjun) existence is his father Valmiki (Murli Sharma, giving a brilliant performance). The older man likes putting down his son at every opportunity, reminding him of his fate for having been born in a middle-class family. He seems more interested in his boss Ramachandra’s (Jayram) son Raj Manohar (Sushanth A) than his own and there’s a reason for it. The chaos that ensues when Bantu finds out the truth about his father and enters Vaikunthapurram (the lavish home Ramachandra and his family stay at) in a bid to help them is worth watching. But not because the film pulls of something new, it doesn’t

                          NTR IS THE REAL HERO OF TOLLYWOOD KING. ANDARU MOVIE TAPPAKA CHUDANDI BLOCK BUSTER MOVIE. TQ.<br>

                          "Just now watch the movie realy good movie,, but set up bad for set , story ok ntr act super no words of it remaing movie equl to rangasthalam i am fan pawan kalyan "<br>

                          NTR is a top class actor and there is no doubt in that. But what happens when an actor like him gets to act in the direction of Trivikram. The answer is Aravinda Sametha. As expected, NTR showcases superb variations in the film and gives a powerful performance. Not to forget NTR’s six-pack look which will give all the fans goosebumps moments in the theaters.

                           <b><h3>Yavadu Story:-</h3></b>Sathya (Allu Arjun) is left fighting for his life after Dheeru Bhai (Rahul Dev) and gang kill his girlfriend Deepth (Kajal). Sathya is saved by a miraculous face transplant surgery and he returns to take his revenge. The face belongs to a guy called Charan (Ram Charan) and his past catches up with Sathya.<br><br>


                           <h3><b>Yavadu review :-</b></h3>

                            What made John Woo’s Face Off a great film wasn’t just the premise of a face/identity swap. The attention to detail is what made it believable. Sean Archer (John Travolta) has a micro chip implanted in his larynx to make him sound like Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), and is shown undergoing a slew of corrective plastic surgeries on the rest of his body as well as plot device to get the audience in on it.<br>

                            The movie is laced with plenty of brilliantly conceived episodes that establish that it’s just the bodies that are exchanged and not the personalities. While the biological merit of those purported surgeries could be contested, it reflects the filmmaker’s respect for the viewers’ intelligence. It’s something mana Tollywood filmmakers lack completely.<br>

                            So when Allu Arjun comes out sounding and behaving like Ram Charan after the ‘face transplant’ we are supposed to cheer for the star rather than the character he’s supposed to be playing. Guess the audience (the reviewers included) have little option other than suffering the intelligence (the lack of it rather) of the filmmakers. The sad part is this kind of stuff is actually not bad by our general standards.
